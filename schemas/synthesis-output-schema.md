# Synthesis Output Schema

The synthesis evaluation MUST conform to this exact structure. No sections may be added or omitted.

## TriView Synthesis

### Consensus Points
[Where all three personas agree — and why that agreement may or may not be reliable]

### Points of Disagreement
[Where personas diverge — explain the underlying framework tension causing the split]

### Verdict Summary Table

| Dimension | Eleanor Grant (Value) | Daniel Cho (Compounder) | Victor Alvarez (Macro) |
|-----------|----------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Rating | | | |
| Confidence | | | |
| Time Horizon | | | |
| Position Size | | | |

### Where the Market May Be Mispricing
[The strongest non-consensus insight that emerges from the persona debate]

### Overall Risk-Reward Profile
[1–2 paragraph synthesis of the three perspectives into a coherent risk-reward assessment]

### Key KPIs to Monitor
[Top 3–5 metrics or events that all frameworks agree matter most for the next 6–12 months]

## Field Definitions

### Consensus Points
- Identify specific conclusions where all three personas converge
- For each consensus point, assess whether the agreement is:
  - **Strong consensus**: Different frameworks independently reach the same conclusion for different reasons
  - **Weak consensus**: Agreement may stem from shared information bias (all read the same report)
- If all three personas agree on the verdict (Buy/Watchlist/Avoid), explicitly state what would need to be true for that consensus to be wrong

### Points of Disagreement
- Identify the exact dimension(s) of disagreement: rating, confidence, time horizon, position size, or risk assessment
- Trace each disagreement to the framework difference that causes it
- Do NOT declare one persona correct — explain the analytical tension
- Use specific quotes or references from each persona's evaluation

### Verdict Summary Table
- Extract directly from each persona's output
- All cells must be filled
- Position Size maps from each persona's Position Sizing Suggestion

### Where the Market May Be Mispricing
- Identify the strongest insight that emerges from the three-way debate
- This should be non-obvious — not a restatement of the bull or bear case
- Explain which persona's framework surfaces this insight and why the other frameworks may underweight it

### Overall Risk-Reward Profile
- 1–2 paragraphs maximum
- Must integrate all three perspectives, not favor one
- Frame as "the intersection of three disciplined viewpoints"
- Acknowledge where the risk-reward assessment is framework-dependent

### Key KPIs to Monitor
- 3 to 5 specific, measurable metrics or events
- For each KPI, note which persona(s) flagged it and why
- If personas disagree on which KPIs matter most, note the disagreement
- KPIs should be forward-looking (next 6–12 months)

### Disclaimer
- Must appear verbatim as specified
- Non-negotiable

## Validation Rules

The application layer should verify:
1. All 7 section headers are present (including Disclaimer)
2. Verdict Summary Table contains all 4 rows and 3 persona columns
3. All table cells are populated (not empty)
4. Key KPIs to Monitor lists 3–5 items
5. Disclaimer text is present

If validation fails, present the output with a formatting notice — do not discard useful analysis over formatting.
